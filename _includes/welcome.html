              Entitled “Translational Research: Linking Science and Daily Life”, EAPS 2018 will focus on the importance of translatability in basic scientific research and the tools and techniques available to turn basic science discoveries into practical solutions in health and the environment. The Symposium will explore a range of fields, from cellular to systems biology, bioinformatics to neurobiology, virology to ecology with a range of distinguished keynote and plenary speakers, as well as oral and poster presentations from students.
