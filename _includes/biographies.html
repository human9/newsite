                      <p>Originally trained as a renal physician and clinical immunologist at Edinburgh University, Professor Ian Frazer came to Australia and joined the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI) in 1981, where he became particularly interested in human papilloma viruses (HPV). Frazerâ€™s scientific achievements include the groundbreaking development of a vaccine preventing HPV infection and cervical cancer. He has continued in this line of work, heading a biotechnology company, Admedus Vaccines, working on new vaccine technologies. Professor Frazer is the current president of the Australian Academy of Health and Medical Sciences, and in 2011 became the founding CEO and Director of Research at the Translational Research Institute (TRI) in Brisbane, however he has since relinquished this role to focus more on his research. He has received a number of highly distinguished awards for his work, including the CSIRO Eureka Prize for Leadership in Science (2005), Australian of the Year in 2006, Prime Ministers Prize for Science and the Balzan Prize (2008), and was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia in 2013.</p>
